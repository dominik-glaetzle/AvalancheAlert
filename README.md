### Technology Stack
- Backend
    - Appwrite
    - Later on, I plan to handle the backend in Java on my own

- Frontend
  - TypeScript
  - React
  - MUI Components
  - TailwindCSS
  - Vite

### Run Frontend
Prerequisites:
- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 9

The frontend can be installed and run with the following commands:
1. `cd frontend`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

It is advisable to open `package.json` as IDEA will recognize the `vite` commands and provide a run configuration.

The project uses vite as a bundler, which enables hot module replacement and fast builds.
This means you can work on the frontend and see the changes in the browser without having to reload the page.

The application is accessible via [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).
